We built an agent for named 'agent-coffee-bot' in  Amazon Bedrock. 
The agent is responsible for coordinating the requests from the user and responses from the restaurant 

The agent uses customer requests to create a prompt. It, then, uses the API schema to invoke
corresponding code in the Lambda function.
